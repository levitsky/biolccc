The choice of tools behind libBioLCCC
=====================================

The main platform of libBioLCCC/pyBioLCCC development is Linux. We prefer it for
its flexibility and vast automation capabilities.

For several reasons Python is highly involved at every stage of libBioLCCC
development. Being initially just a convenient language for libBioLCCC testing
and usage, it became a tool for version control, building and distribution.

This choice of tools is very powerful while being homogeneous and 
cross-platform.
