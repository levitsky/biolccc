Compiling libBioLCCC on Linux.
*******************************
The main platform of libBioLCCC/pyBioLCCC development is Linux. We prefer it for
its flexibility and vast automation capabilities.

For several reasons Python is highly involved at every stage of libBioLCCC
development. Being initially just a convenient language for libBioLCCC testing
and usage, it became a tool for version control, building and distribution.

This choice of tools is very powerful while being homogeneous and 
cross-platform.

In order to compile libBioLCCC you need to have the following tools installed:
a) Python 2.6 (other versions 2.x are accepted, but not tested yet)
b) SCons build system.
c) SWIG interface wrapped.
d) (optional) bazaar version control system.

All these tools can be installed via the main repository of your Linux
distribution. However, it was tested on Ubuntu only.

Download the source code, make separate build directory (!) and print in it:
scons -Y /path/to/source/directory.

The build scripts will done everything else for you.
If you want to compile and install the Python package print in the build
directory:
python setup.py build
or
python setup.py install


Compiling libBioLCCC/pyBioLCCC on Windows.
*******************************************

As we mentioned, the main platform of libBioLCCC/pyBioLCCC development is Linux.
However, we clearly understand the importance of the Windows and try to write 
only platform-independent code and use only cross-platform tools. However, the 
libBioLCCC development team is still very small (i.e. a single person),
so our testing and packaging capabilities are extremely limited.

So far the packaging for Windows was done using Wine+MinGW32. The instructions 
are the following:

1. Install the latest Wine distribution. On Debian-based systems it is done via:
sudo apt-get install wine

2. Install the latest MinGW distribution UNDER the Wine. In order to do that:
    2.1. Download and install the latest version of MinGW-get:
        wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/MinGW%205.1.6/MinGW-5.1.6.exe/download -P /tmp/
        wine /tmp/MinGW-5.1.6.exe
        Keep the installation directory by default.
    2.2. Download and install the latest versions of SCons and SWIG.

3. If you plan to upload the pyBioLCCC-derived packages to PyPi then:
    3.1. Set the HOME environment variable to "C:\users\your_user", where 
        replace your_user by your login name in Linux.
        In order to set this variable print 'wine regedit' in console. Using the
        regedit window navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Environment and right-click
        on the right field choosing, Add->String value.
    3.2. Create .pypirc in C:\users\your_user and fill it with the following
        text:
            [distutils]
            index-servers =
                pypi

            [pypi]
            username:<username>
            password:<password>
        Where <username> and <password> are the ones from your PyPi account.
