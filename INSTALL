Installing pyteomics.biolccc from the Python Package Index (PyPi)
*****************************************************************

GNU/Linux
=========

The preferred way to obtain pyteomics.biolccc is via pip Python 
package manager. The shell code for a freshly installed Ubuntu system:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev build-essential
    sudo easy_install pip
    sudo pip install pyteomics.biolccc

Windows
=======

The easiest way to install pyteomics.biolccc on Windows is by using a 
precompiled .exe package available for download from the pyteomics.biolccc page
on PyPi: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyteomics.biolccc/

If a precompiled package for your version of Python is not available,
you may compile it yourself. The ready-to-use Python distributions,
like ActivePython Community Edition or Enthought Python Distribution,
already contain all the tools required for package building. The
latter is free for academic use. With these distributions, pyteomics.biolccc
can be installed via the standard routine:

.. code-block:: bash

    easy_install pip
    pip install pyteomics.biolccc

If your distribution lacks building tools, you may try to install them
yourself.

1) You will need to download and install MinGW compiler suite
(available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/mingw-get-inst/). Note
that a C++ compiler is not installed by default and should be checked
during the installation process.

2) Download and install the setuptools package (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).

3) Execute the following commands in the command line:
         
.. code-block:: bash
   
    echo [build] > %HOMEPATH%\pydistutils.cfg
    echo compiler = mingw32 >> %HOMEPATH%\pydistutils.cfg
    c:\Python27\Scripts\easy_install.exe pip
    c:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install pyteomics.biolccc
 
Do not forget to change the path to the python distribution according to your
own directory structure.

Building libBioLCCC/pyteomics.biolccc from sources
**************************************************

The source code is available online at http://hg.theorchromo.ru/biolccc.
You can download the archived source code or pull the mercurial repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    hg clone http://hg.theorchromo.ru/biolccc

GNU/Linux
=========

In order to compile pyteomics.biolccc you need the following tools to 
be installed:

* GNU C++ compiler
* Python 2.6 or 2.7 (other versions 2.x are accepted, but not tested)
* (pyteomics.biolccc) python-dev package
* (pyteomics.biolccc) SWIG interface wrapper
* (documentation) Doxygen documentation system
* (documentation) Sphinx documentation system, version >= 1.0.0
* (documentation) DVIPNG converter
* (documentation) matplotlib Python library 
* (optional) Mercurial version control system

All these tools can be installed from the main repository of your
Linux distribution and/or via pip/easy_install packaging system of
Python. Under Ubuntu or Debian these dependencies can be satisfied
using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev swig \
                 doxygen python-sphinx python-matplotlib dvipng \
                 python-setuptools

In order to compile and install the Python package:

* Build the target 'pyteomics.biolccc' outside the source directory 
  using the build script.:

  .. code-block:: bash

      python build.py -b /path/to/build/directory pyteomics.biolccc

* Run setup.py then:

  .. code-block:: bash

      python setup.py install

  or

  .. code-block:: bash

      python setup.py build

  In the latter case, the built library can be found in build/lib directory.

Windows
=======

The main platform of libBioLCCC/pyteomics.biolccc development is Linux.
However, we clearly understand importance of Windows and write 
platform-independent code and use only the cross-platform tools.
All the C++ code present in the project can be compiled under Windows platform.
