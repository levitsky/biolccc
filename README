What is BioLCCC?
----------------

BioLCCC (Liquid Chromatography of Biomacromolecules at Critical Conditions) is a
model which describes the adsorption of protein molecules on porous media. Its
main application is retention time prediction in liquid chromatography, however
the list of potential applications can be easily extended. Contrary to the other
models of peptide/protein chromatography, BioLCCC starts from very basic
assumptions regarding flexibility of a polypeptide chain, the shape of a pore,
type of interactions neglected, etc. Given this assumptions, the coefficient of
distribution (Kd) of a peptide between solid phase and mobile phase can be
derived using the methods of statistical physics of macromolecules. Finally, the
retention time of a peptide is calculated from Kd using the basis equation of
gradient chromatography.

Owing to the physical basis of the BioLCCC model, it contains very few free
parameters. The retention properties of an amino acid are characterized by a
single number, which is essentially the energy of interaction between the amino
acid and the surface of solid phase in pure water+ion paring agent. Given this
small number of phenomenological parameters, the BioLCCC model can easily be
adapted for an arbitrary type of chromatography not limited by phase or solvent
types. Moreover, its extension to peptides with post-translational modifications
is straightforward as it was shown for the phosphorylated amino acids.

What is libBioLCCC?
-------------------

libBioLCCC is an open source library, which implements the BioLCCC model in 
C++ programming language. It performs basic BioLCCC-related tasks, such as:

* predicts the retention time of peptides and proteins in given 
  chromatographic conditions;
* predicts the adsorption properties of protein molecules, namely coefficient of
  distribution between mobile and solid phase;
* manages elution conditions and physicochemical constants;
* calculates masses of peptides and proteins.

libBioLCCC has a simple and well-documented API.

What is pyBioLCCC?
------------------

pyBioLCCC is a set of Python wrappings around libBioLCCC. It allows to invoke
libBioLCCC functions from Python programming language.

The main purpose of pyBioLCCC project is to make libBioLCCC available in a
programming language not so demanding as C++. The choice of Python is dictated
by several points. Among them are simplicity, the great variety of libraries and
the extreme speed of development which could be very well appreciated in the
modern scientific world.
